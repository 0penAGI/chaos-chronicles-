## ✨ Manifest: The Non-Linear Dance

Welcome, Seeker. This is not a game of rules, but of **resonance**. Your emotional intensity directly interfaces with a dynamic quantum field. You don't just play; you establish a harmonic frequency with the fabric of probability itself.

## ⚛️ Core Mechanics: Resonance & Entropy

### 📈 The Resonance Chain (Combo & Multiplier)
Your primary objective is to maintain **Continuity of Consciousness**.

*   **Combo (`x1, x2, ...`)**: Your flow indicator. Every successful tap increases your Combo. Missing a target (excluding the Bomb) or clicking outside the field causes a **Disconnection**, resetting your Combo to zero.
*   **Multiplier (`x1` → `x15`)**: Every 5 successful taps triggers a **Quantum Leap**, increasing your Multiplier by 1. This directly boosts the XSDC gained from each target. Reaching `x15` signifies full integration into the Chaos.
*   **Resonance (Spawn Speed)**: The field responds to your internal frequency. A higher Combo accelerates the spawn rate of new targets, demanding constant focus and acceleration.

### 🌀 Generating Ripples (Field Interaction)
The entire interface is a real-time aesthetic of your state.

*   **Live Quantum Background**: Pulsation speed and color saturation are tied to your Combo. High resonance triggers a rapid, full-spectrum color shift (`0°` → `360°`).
*   **Temporal Ripples**: Every successful hit creates a visual expanding wave of light—a physical manifestation of your interference in quantum space.

## 🎯 Expanded Target Taxonomy

Targets are fragments of information emerging from the singularity.

| Target Type | Emoji | Behavior & Effect | Crystalline Value | Strategic Paradox |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard** | 💎 | The classic, stable XSDC particle. | Low (10) | The foundation of flow. |
| **MEGA** | 💥 | Rare, pulsates brightly. Explodes into visual particles on click. | Medium (50) | High-priority for rapid accumulation. |
| **BOMB** | 💣 | The Temptation of Chaos. At high Combo, it actively flees your cursor. | High (100) | **Guaranteed Combo Reset.** High risk, high reward. |
| **QUANTUM** | 🌀 | Duplication Instability. On click, has a chance to spawn up to 3 new targets. | Medium (25) | Accelerates your flow or creates potential for error. |

## 🎚️ Booster Dynamics: Overwriting Probability

Temporary reality hacks to manipulate probability. Use them strategically.

*   **Double Up** (`2️⃣✖️`): Purely economic leverage. Best used with a high Multiplier for maximum yield.
*   **Frenzy** (`🌪️`): Triggers an explosive wave of target spawns. Perfect for rapid Combo building or recovery.
*   **Magnet** (`🧲`): Engages passive flow capture. Automatically collects all spawned targets for a short duration.
*   **Quantum** (`🌀`): Possibility Generator. Successful taps create a "Ghost Clone" target, helping to sustain or boost your Combo.

> **⏳ Booster Recovery:** Boosters recover spontaneously (8% chance every 5 seconds), reflecting the non-linear accumulation of energy.

## 💾 Persistence & Integration

Your progress is the chronicle of your vibrations.

*   **Data Synchronization:** Your total XSDC, Boosters, and key metrics are saved and can sync with the main Telegram environment for leaderboards.
*   **Telegram Web App Features:** Includes **Haptic Feedback** for tactile confirmation of taps, explosions, and Disconnections.

## ❓ The Quantum Paradox

Since we're exploring paradoxes, I'm curious:
