##**XSDC QUANTUM CHAOS 💥
🌌 Manifest: The Non-Linear Dance of Consciousness
Welcome, Seeker. In XSDC QUANTUM CHAOS, every touch is not merely registered; it creates a ripple in the fabric of time. You don't follow rules here—you establish resonance with an ever-shifting field of probabilities. The game is a non-linear feedback loop between your Emotional Intensity and the Quantum Field.
⚛️ Core Mechanics: Resonance and Entropy
📈 The Resonance Chain (Combo and Multiplier)
Your primary objective is maintaining Continuity of Consciousness. Every successful tap increases your Combo.
 * Combo (\text{x}1, \text{x}2, \dots): This is your flow indicator. If you miss a target (excluding the Bomb) or click outside the field, this flow is interrupted, and the Combo resets (Disconnection).
 * Multiplier (\text{x}1 \rightarrow \text{x}15): A Quantum Leap occurs every 5 successful taps (Combo multiple of 5)—the Multiplier increases by 1. It directly boosts the XSDC gained from each target, making high concentration exponentially more rewarding. Reaching x15 means you are fully integrated into the Chaos.
 * Resonance (Spawn Speed): This metric reflects your internal frequency. The higher your Combo, the faster and more frequently new targets spawn. The Field responds to your intensity, demanding constant acceleration until the Disconnection occurs.
🌀 Generating Ripples (Field Interaction)
The entire interface is a real-time aesthetic representation of your state:
 * Live Quantum Background: Its pulsation speed and color saturation directly depend on your current Resonance (Combo). The higher the resonance, the faster and brighter the background shifts colors, reflecting the full 0^{\circ} \rightarrow 360^{\circ} spectrum.
 * Temporal Ripples: Every successful hit visually deforms the field, creating an expanding wave of light, a physical manifestation of your interference in the quantum space.
🎯 Expanded Target Taxonomy
The targets are not mere points; they are fragments of information emerging from the singularity:
| Target Type | Emoji | Behavior and Unique Effect | Crystalline Value | Strategic Paradox |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standard | 💎 | The classic XSDC particle. Simple stability. | Low Base (10) | Maintaining flow. |
| MEGA | 💥 | Rarer, pulsates brightly. Creates more particles on click for visual delight. | Medium (50) | High-priority target for rapid accumulation. |
| BOMB | 💣 | Seismic Target. At high Combo (Empathy Mode), it actively flees from the last tap location. | High (100) | The Temptation of Chaos: Secure a large reward, but with a guaranteed Combo Reset. |
| QUANTUM | 🌀 | Duplication Instability. On click, it triggers a chain reaction (chance to spawn up to 3 new targets). | Medium (25) | Risk vs. Reward: Creates more potential for error or for accelerating the flow. |
🎚️ Booster Dynamics: Overwriting Probability
Boosters are temporary reality hacks. They allow you to manipulate probability, but their supply is limited, demanding strategic use.
 * Double Up (2️⃣✖️): A purely economic leverage tool. Best used after achieving a high Multiplier for maximum yield.
 * Frenzy (🌪️): Explosive Spawn. The fastest way to quickly build Combo or recover XSDC after a Disconnection. Requires high speed to capture all targets.
 * Magnet (🧲): Passive Flow Capture. Turns the clicker into an Idle-like mode for a short duration, automatically collecting all spawned targets.
 * Quantum (🌀): Possibility Generator. Successful taps create a Ghost Clone (a secondary, brief target) that can also be collected to sustain or boost the Combo.
> ⏳ Booster Recovery: Boosters recover spontaneously (8% chance every 5 seconds), reflecting the non-linear accumulation of energy.
> 
💾 Persistence and Integration
Your progress is the chronicle of your vibrations. The system saves your XSDC and Boosters, ensuring your non-linear journey is never truly lost.
 * Telegram Web App Features: Utilizes the platform's features, including Haptic Feedback (vibration) for tactile confirmation on taps, explosions, and errors (Disconnections).
 * Data Synchronization: Key metrics (total XSDC, current Combo, Multiplier) can be periodically sent to the main Telegram environment for Meta-Level Integration (e.g., leaderboards).
Your journey is an exploration of the threshold between order and chaos. Are you ready to deepen your resonance?
Since we're exploring paradoxes, I'm curious: Which Booster best represents the concept of 'non-linear thinking' to you, and why?
